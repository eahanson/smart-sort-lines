**Smart Sort Lines** sorts lines of code with a little bit of intelligence.

If all but the last line of text end with a comma, then after sorting, all but the last line of text will still
end with a comma.

If the first line of text is a left bracket and the last line of text is a right bracket, they will not be sorted.

## Usage

To run Smart Sort Lines:

- Select the **Editor â†’ Smart Sort Lines** menu item; or
- Open the command palette and type `Smart Sort Lines`
